# SoundCrate Front-End Design

## Description

SoundCrate is a web application that allows users to rate and review music interactively. Our inspiration came from LetterBoxd (an application for rating and reviewing movies). This repository consists of the front-end portion of the web application. It showcases mainly just the design, but also some functionality as well.
